# EX-04: SGD-Regressor-for-Multivariate-Linear-Regression

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the price of the house and number of occupants in the house with SGD regressor.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm:
Load and Prepare the Dataset: Fetch the dataset and create a DataFrame, adding the target variable for housing prices.<br>

Data Splitting: Separate the features (X) and target (Y) variables, and split the data into training and testing sets.<br>

Feature Scaling: Apply feature scaling (StandardScaler) to normalize the features and target variables for better performance.<br>

Model Initialization: Initialize the SGDRegressor model, and use the MultiOutputRegressor to handle multiple target variables.<br>

Model Training: Fit the model on the training data (scaled features and target values).<br>

Prediction and Evaluation: Use the trained model to predict on the test set, inverse transform the predictions, and calculate the Mean Squared Error for model evaluation.
